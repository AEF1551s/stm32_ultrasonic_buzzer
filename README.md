# STM32_ultrasonic_buzzer

This is simple excercise for STM32F410RBT6 microcontroller which is part of NUCLEO-F410RB development board.  
The goal is to write a program that measures distance with ultrasonic sensor and based on that makes buzzer sounds.   
This program uses 1 buzzer, 1 HR-SR04 ultrasonic sensor.

This project includes minimal headers for STM32F4xx.  
This project **does not** include any HAL header files.  
&nbsp;  
This project has been configured and generated by CubeIDE. Compiling and flashing is also done by CubeIDE.

# Overview  
## Drivers  
Contains CMSIS drivers for STM32F4xx microcontrollers.  
## Inc  
Contains user defined header files.  
## Src  
Contains user defined source files.  

&nbsp;  
# Prerequisites
## Linux based systems  
* CubeIDE installed. See ` https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html`.  
&nbsp;  
# Build  
Use CubeIDE to build and flash the NUCLEO development board.

# Notes  
To make the buzzer sound continous, PWM is needed. In this project a delay is used.  
Next goal is to use PWM for buzzer.
